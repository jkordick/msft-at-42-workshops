# What The Hack - Container Intro

## Introduction

This intro level hack will help you get hands-on experience with Docker.

This hack starts off by covering containers, what problems they solve. By the end, you should have a good understanding of what containers are, how they work, and how to use them.

## Learning Objectives

In this hack you will solve a common challenge for companies migrating to the cloud. You will take a simple multi-tiered web app and containerize it (for now).

1. Containerize an application
1. Run a containerized application locally
